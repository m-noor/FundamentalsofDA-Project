# Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Project
## Project for the GMIT HDip in Data Analysis Course

### Brief introduction
This repository summarizes the use of box plot and other alternative plots for visualizing the [Road Accident Deaths in US States](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/road.html) dataset. The Python Plotly library is used to generate various types of plots for a visual comparison.

This repository contains the following files:

1. [README.md](README.md) (this file)
1. [FundamentalsOfDA-Project.ipynb](FundamentalsOfDA-Project.ipynb) - a Jupyter Notebook written in Python.
1. [FundamentalsOfDA-Project.pdf](FundamentalsOfDA-Project.pdf) - PDF version of the Notebook. Note this is for reference only as the notebook is not accurately reproducible through conversion to PDF. No interactivity with plots are possible.
1. [FundamentalsofDA-project-instructions.pdf](FundamentalsofDA-project-instructions.pdf) - instructions for the assignment, for future reference only.
1. [road.csv](road.csv) - the Road Accident Deaths in US States
1. [images](images) - a container folder for various images referenced in the Jupyter Notebook.

### Pre-requisites for running the notebook
This notebook relies on the following libraries, so please ensure you have these installed on your machine before running.

1. `Pandas`
1. `plotly`

### Troubleshooting / known issues
There might be problems in generating Plotly plots in Jupyter Notebook within the Opera web browser depending on the exact combination of Plotly, Jupyter and Opera versions. This notebook was written in Mozilla Firefox with Plotly 3.4.2.
